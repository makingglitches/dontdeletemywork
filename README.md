# dontdeletemywork
A repo to indicate that we don't want our work deleted while in maine over the next year. people need to keep their hands off our work. not trying to have to recreate or lose all motivation. had continued working on google photo download and shapefile  and census scripts at one point stop stealing

so i don't know why things are getting roled back when things like html 5 and css are actually stable and work now.
kind of annoying.
even though i'd rather see a webkit implementation that wasnt based off a full browser.
